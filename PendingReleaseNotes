Upgrading
---------

* Ceph daemons now run as user and group ceph by default.  The ceph user has a
  static UID assigned by Fedora and Debian (also used by derivative distributions
  like RHEL/CentOS and Ubuntu).  On SUSE the ceph user will currently get a
  dynamically assigned UID when the user is created.

  If your systems already have a ceph user, upgrading the package will cause
  problems.  We suggest you first remove or rename the existing 'ceph' user
  before upgrading.

  When upgrading, administrators have two options:

   #. Add the following line to ``ceph.conf`` on all hosts::

        setuser match path = /var/lib/ceph/$type/$cluster-$id

      This will make the Ceph daemons run as root (i.e., not drop
      privileges and switch to user ceph) if the daemon's data
      directory is still owned by root.  Newly deployed daemons will
      be created with data owned by user ceph and will run with
      reduced privileges, but upgraded daemons will continue to run as
      root.

   #. Fix the data ownership during the upgrade.  This is the preferred option,
      but is more work.  The process for each host would be to:

      #. Upgrade the ceph package.  This creates the ceph user and group.
      #. Stop the daemon(s)
      #. Fix the ownership.  E.g.,::

          chown -R ceph:ceph /var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-foo
	  chown -R ceph:ceph /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-123

      #. Restart the daemon(s)

* The on-disk format for the experimental KeyValueStore OSD backend has
  changed.  You will need to remove any OSDs using that backend before you
  upgrade any test clusters that use it.
